# C_projects
Projects created while learning the C programming language.

Most of these programs were writted while going through the Harvard/edX 'CS50' course (2023).

A few of these still need to be completed (tideman and reverse, as of 01.09.2023).

I will be revisiting these to create README files for each, as well as to improve the documentation in general.
